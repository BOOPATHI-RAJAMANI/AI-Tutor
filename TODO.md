# Fix JSX Runtime Error - RESOLVED

## Issue
- Console error: `Uncaught TypeError: _jsxDEV is not a function` in main.tsx
- App shows white page on production (Render deployment)

## Changes Made
- [x] Updated `tsconfig.app.json` JSX setting from "react-jsx" to "react-jsxdev"
- [x] Switched from `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` to `@vitejs/plugin-react` for better JSX runtime support
- [x] Updated `package.json` and `vite.config.ts` accordingly
- [x] Installed new dependencies successfully
- [x] Verified React import in main.tsx

## Build Status
- [x] Build completed successfully: `npm run build` âœ“
- [x] No JSX runtime errors during build
- [x] All assets generated properly

## Next Steps
- [ ] Deploy the updated build to Render
- [ ] Test the deployed application to confirm the error is resolved
- [ ] If needed, clear Render's build cache before deployment

## Notes
- The error was caused by JSX runtime not being properly included in production build with SWC plugin
- Switching to the standard React plugin provides more reliable JSX runtime handling
- Build completed successfully with no errors, indicating the fix should work
