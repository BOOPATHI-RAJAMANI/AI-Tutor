# Profile Setup Fix TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed current authentication and profile flow
- [x] Confirmed global redirection logic in App.tsx
- [x] Verified login navigation to home page

## Pending Tasks
- [x] Modify ProfileSetup.tsx to redirect existing users to home page

- [ ] Ensure no forced profile updates for existing users

## Summary of Changes
- Add redirection in ProfileSetup.tsx if profile already exists
